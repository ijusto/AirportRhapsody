/**
 * The General Repository of Information works solely as the place where the visible internal state of the problem
 * is stored. The visible internal state is defined by the set of variables whose value is printed in the logging file.
 * Whenever an entity (porter, passenger, bus driver) executes an operation that changes the values of some of these
 * variables, the fact must be reported so that a new line group is printed in the logging file. The report operation
 * must be atomic, that is, when two or more variables are changed, the report operation must be unique so that the new
 * line group reflects all the changes that have taken place.
